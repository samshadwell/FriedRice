Python script behind the Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/FriedRiceNews

Script crawls the Facebook pages specified in config.py and gets their posts (from the last n days as specified in config.py). Then runs part of speech tagging on those posts and randomly swaps out text for other text of the same tag.

I made this because I was tired of being asked to like random Rice University Facebook pages, so I wanted to humorously combine all the content from those pages onto this one.

This project is not associated with Rice University in any official context.
